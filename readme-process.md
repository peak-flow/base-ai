# Implementation Process

This document tracks the implementation steps and changes made to the application.

## Initial Planning (March 24, 2025)

- Discussed project requirements and goals
- Determined tech stack (Laravel, PostgreSQL with pgvector, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS)
- Planned database architecture and ERD
- Outlined core features and implementation approach

## Current Status
- [x] Project planning and architecture design
- [x] Laravel project setup
- [x] Basic dashboard layout with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Authentication implementation (Laravel Breeze)
- [ ] PostgreSQL configuration with pgvector
- [ ] Database migrations for core entities
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations for projects and tasks
- [ ] Chat interface for LLM integration
- [ ] Chat embeddings for conversation context (simplified RAG approach)
- [ ] Model comparison feature

## Updates (March 24, 2025)
- Simplified vector database approach to focus only on chat messages initially
- Decided to start without authentication for faster initial development
- Created basic dashboard layout with Tailwind CSS
- Set up project structure and routing

## Updates (March 25, 2025)
- Implemented basic chat interface with standard form submissions
- Integrated with local LLM API using session-based message storage
- Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- Enhanced chat functionality to use chat completions API format
- Added support for system messages and chat history context
- Improved error handling and logging in chat components
- Created LLM service architecture with the following components:
  - `LlmClient`: Handles HTTP communication with the local LLM API
  - `LlmTransformerInterface`: Interface for different LLM implementations
  - `LocalLlmTransformer`: Implementation for the local LLM
  - `ChatService`: Service for handling chat message processing
  - `LlmServiceProvider`: Service provider for binding LLM services
  - `LlmLogger`: Service for logging LLM requests and responses
- Added configuration for LLM services in `config/services.php`
- Simplified chat interface to use standard form submissions instead of AJAX
- Implemented session-based message storage for chat history
- Added dedicated logging for LLM interactions with the following features:
  - Created a dedicated 'llm' log channel in `config/logging.php`
  - Implemented `LlmLogger` service using dependency injection
  - Added request and response logging with content truncation for readability
  - Included conversation IDs for tracking related messages

## Next Steps
- Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- Create database migrations for core entities
- Implement basic project management functionality
- Implement task management functionality
- Improve LLM logging format for better readability and analysis
- Add authentication when needed
- Consider adding streaming responses from the LLM in the future
