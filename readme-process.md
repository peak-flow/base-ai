# Implementation Process

This document tracks the implementation steps and changes made to the application.

## Initial Planning (March 24, 2025)

- Discussed project requirements and goals
- Determined tech stack (Laravel, PostgreSQL with pgvector, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS)
- Planned database architecture and ERD
- Outlined core features and implementation approach

## Current Status
- [x] Project planning and architecture design
- [x] Laravel project setup
- [x] Basic dashboard layout with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Authentication implementation (Laravel Breeze)
- [ ] PostgreSQL configuration with pgvector
- [ ] Database migrations for core entities
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations for projects and tasks
- [ ] Chat interface for LLM integration
- [ ] Chat embeddings for conversation context (simplified RAG approach)
- [ ] Model comparison feature

## Updates (March 24, 2025)
- Simplified vector database approach to focus only on chat messages initially
- Decided to start without authentication for faster initial development
- Created basic dashboard layout with Tailwind CSS
- Set up project structure and routing

## Updates (March 25, 2025)
- Implemented basic chat interface with standard form submissions
- Integrated with local LLM API using session-based message storage
- Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- Enhanced chat functionality to use chat completions API format
- Added support for system messages and chat history context
- Improved error handling and logging in chat components
- Created LLM service architecture with the following components:
  - `LlmClient`: Handles HTTP communication with the local LLM API
  - `LlmTransformerInterface`: Interface for different LLM implementations
  - `LocalLlmTransformer`: Implementation for the local LLM
  - `ChatService`: Service for handling chat message processing
  - `LlmServiceProvider`: Service provider for binding LLM services
  - `LlmLogger`: Service for logging LLM requests and responses
- Added configuration for LLM services in `config/services.php`
- Simplified chat interface to use standard form submissions instead of AJAX
- Implemented session-based message storage for chat history
- Added dedicated logging for LLM interactions with the following features:
  - Created a dedicated 'llm' log channel in `config/logging.php`
  - Implemented `LlmLogger` service using dependency injection
  - Added request and response logging with content truncation for readability
  - Included conversation IDs for tracking related messages
- Added support for multiple LLM providers:
  - Created `OpenAiTransformer` for integration with OpenAI API
  - Updated `LlmClient` to support custom headers for API authentication
  - Modified `LlmServiceProvider` to dynamically select the appropriate transformer
  - Added configuration options in `services.php` and `.env.example`
  - Implemented provider switching via the `LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable

## Updates (March 25, 2025 - Afternoon)
- Implemented embedding functionality with OpenAI integration:
  - Created `EmbeddingTransformerInterface` for a pluggable architecture
  - Implemented `OpenAiEmbeddingTransformer` for OpenAI embeddings API
  - Developed `EmbeddingService` with vector similarity calculation
  - Added embedding configuration to `services.php` and `jana.php`
  - Created embedding test controller and view for validation
  - Updated routes and navigation to include embedding tool
  - Added support for text similarity comparison

## Updates (March 25, 2025 - Evening)
- Implemented comprehensive PHPUnit tests for embedding functionality:
  - Created `EmbeddingServiceTest` to test the embedding service
  - Implemented `OpenAiEmbeddingTransformerTest` to test the OpenAI transformer
  - Added tests for generating embeddings, calculating similarity, and finding similar embeddings
  - Ensured proper mocking of dependencies for isolated unit testing
  - Verified that all tests pass with the new `text-embedding-3-large` model
  - Confirmed embedding dimension increased from 1536 to 3072 with the new model
  - Validated that similarity calculations work correctly for various text pairs

## Updates (March 25, 2025 - Late Evening)
- Implemented PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector database functionality:
  - Created database migration for embeddings table with vector(3072) column
  - Implemented Embedding model with methods for vector operations
  - Developed EmbeddingStorageService for storing and retrieving embeddings
  - Configured cosine similarity (`<=>` operator) for semantic search
  - Created comprehensive unit tests for the embedding functionality
  - Verified that vector storage and similarity search work correctly
  - Updated architecture documentation with vector database details
  - Used a simplified approach without repository pattern for clarity

## Next Steps
- Create database migrations for other core entities
- Implement basic project management functionality
- Implement task management functionality
- Improve LLM logging format for better readability and analysis
- Add authentication when needed
- Consider adding streaming responses from the LLM in the future
